# Upload large amounts of data with AWS Snowball<a name="emr-plan-input-snowball"></a>

AWS Snowball is a service you can use to transfer large amounts of data between Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and your onsite data storage location at faster\-than\-internet speeds\. Snowball supports two job types: import jobs and export jobs\. Import jobs involve a data transfer from an on\-premises source to an Amazon S3 bucket\. Export jobs involve a data transfer from an Amazon S3 bucket to an on\-premises source\. For both job types, Snowball devices secure and protect your data while regional shipping carriers transport them between Amazon S3 and your onsite data storage location\. Snowball devices are physically rugged and protected by the AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)\.
