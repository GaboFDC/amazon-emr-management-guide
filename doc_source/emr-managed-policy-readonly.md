# IAM managed policy for read\-only access \(on path to deprecation\)<a name="emr-managed-policy-readonly"></a>

The `AmazonElasticMapReduceReadOnlyAccess` managed policy is on the path to deprecation\. You cannot attach this policy when launching new clusters\. `AmazonElasticMapReduceReadOnlyAccess` has been replaced with [`AmazonEMRReadOnlyAccessPolicy_v2`](emr-managed-policy-readonly-v2.md) as the Amazon EMR default managed policy\. The content of this policy statement is shown in the following snippet\. Wildcard characters for the `elasticmapreduce` element specify that only actions that begin with the specified strings are allowed\. Keep in mind that because this policy does not explicitly deny actions, a different policy statement may still be used to grant access to specified actions\.

**Note**  
You can also use the AWS Management Console to view the policy\.
