# CloudWatch events and metrics<a name="emr-manage-cluster-cloudwatch"></a>

Use events and metrics to track the activity and health of an Amazon EMR cluster\. Events are useful for monitoring a specific occurrence within a cluster \- for example, when a cluster changes state from starting to running\. Metrics are useful for monitoring a specific value \- for example, the percentage of available disk space that HDFS is using within a cluster\.
