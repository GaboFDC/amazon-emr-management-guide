# IAM role for Apache Ranger<a name="emr-ranger-iam-ranger"></a>

This role provides credentials for trusted execution engines, such as Apache Hive and Amazon EMR Record Server [Amazon EMR components](emr-lf-components.md), to access Amazon S3 data\. Use only this role to access Amazon S3 data, including any KMS keys, if you are using S3 SSE\-KMS\.

This role must be created with the minimum policy stated in the following example\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CloudwatchLogsPermissions",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:logs:<REGION>:<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:<CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP_NAME_IN_SECURITY_CONFIGURATION>:*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "BucketPermissionsInS3Buckets",
      "Action": [
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:DeleteBucket",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
 *"arn:aws:s3:::bucket1",
        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket2"*
        ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ObjectPermissionsInS3Objects",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [ 
 *"arn:aws:s3:::bucket1/*",
          "arn:aws:s3:::bucket2/*"
*        ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important**  
The asterisk "\*" at the end of the CloudWatch Log Resource must be included to provide permission to write to the log streams\.

**Note**  
If you are using EMRFS consistency view or S3\-SSE encryption, add permissions to the DynamoDB tables and KMS keys so that execution engines can interact with those engines\.

    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<EC2 INSTANCE PROFILE ROLE NAME eg. EMR_EC2_DefaultRole>"
      },
      "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole", "sts:TagSession"]
    }
